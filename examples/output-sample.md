- Casting: Freelancer, 25–30, casual home office setup (natural light, minimal desk)
- Music vibe: Lo-fi chill, upbeat but not corporate
- Caption: Mandatory (85% watch without sound)

## TA SETTINGS — TaskFlow Pro — Phase 1

**DEMOGRAPHICS (Tier 1 — 3-angle reasoning):**
- Age: 22–35
  → Psychology: Identity-building stage — freelancers actively seeking tools that signal professionalism to clients
  → Use case: Independent budget decision-makers, not locked into enterprise software contracts
  → Cultural: US gig economy growing post-2024; this age group drives freelance platform adoption
- Gender: All → No significant gender skew in North American freelancer demographics
- Location: United States (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin) → Highest freelancer density + disposable income for SaaS tools

**INTEREST STACK (3 Layers — Tier 1):**

| Layer | Description | Interests | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Core | Direct use case | Freelancing, Project Management, Time Tracking | Maps directly to product features |
| 2 — Adjacent | Expand reach | Graphic Design, Web Development, Content Creation | Core users also identify with these |
| 3 — Behavioral | Purchase intent | Engaged Shoppers, Small Business Owners | Decision-making readiness + payment willingness |

**LOOKALIKE (Tier 2):** Website visitors (beta signups) → 1% lookalike. Source: 2,400 beta users.
**PLACEMENTS (Tier 2):** Advantage+ Placements (Phase 1 — need fast data volume).
**NEGATIVE TARGETING:** Exclude existing beta users, competitor employees (Trello/Asana), age < 18, locations outside the United States.

Phase 2 teaser: After 14 days → retarget website visitors + video viewers 50%+.

## BUDGET PLAN — TaskFlow Pro — 14 days

**Total budget:** $1,000 USD | **Daily budget:** $71.43
**Campaign Type:** ABO (timeline ≥ 14 days)

| Ad Set | Audience | Budget/Day | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Broad Test | 22–35, US, no interest | 30% (~$21) | Let Meta find audiences |
| Interest Stack | Layer 1+2 (Freelancing + Design + Dev) | 40% (~$29) | Validate hypothesis |
| LAL 1% | Beta user lookalike | 30% (~$21) | Warm-ish cold audience |

**Learning Phase:** Each ad set needs ~50 conversions/week to exit learning phase. Min budget/ad set = $7 CPA × 2 = $14/day.
**Scale Trigger:** When 1 ad set achieves CPA ≤ $7 for 3 consecutive days → increase budget max 20%/day.
