## VARIANT A — Pain Hook — Video 30s

**Platform:** Facebook Feed / Instagram Reels | **Objective:** Lead Generation

**HOOK (0–5s):**
- Visuals: Close-up of a freelancer staring at 5 browser tabs — Trello, Google Sheets, Slack, an invoice template, and a calendar app. Cursor frantically switching between windows.
- Voiceover: "Still juggling 5 apps just to manage 1 client?"
- Text overlay: "5 apps. 1 client. Sound familiar?"
- Emotion trigger: Frustration / overwhelm

**PROBLEM (5–15s):**
- Visuals: Split-screen montage — left side shows the freelancer copying data between apps, missing a deadline notification, manually formatting an invoice. Right side shows a clock ticking with billable hours draining away.
- Voiceover: "You spend more time switching between tools than actually doing the work you love. Tasks fall through the cracks. Invoices go out late. And clients start to wonder if you've got it together."
- Key message: The hidden cost of a fragmented workflow — lost time, lost revenue, lost credibility
- Supporting proof: "The average freelancer wastes 5+ hours per week on admin tasks"

**SOLUTION (15–25s):**
- Visuals: Screen recording of TaskFlow Pro dashboard — drag a task on Kanban board, click to start the timer, timer runs while working, click "Generate Invoice" and a polished invoice auto-populates with tracked hours. Client portal view shows the client approving a deliverable.
- Voiceover: "TaskFlow Pro puts your tasks, time tracking, and invoicing in one dashboard. Drag, track, invoice — done. Your clients even get their own portal to view progress and approve work."
- Key message: 3-in-1 replacement for your entire tool stack
- Supporting proof: "2,400+ freelancers already switched in beta"

**CTA (25–30s):**
- Visuals: TaskFlow Pro logo on deep purple (#6C3CE1) gradient background. "Try Free for 14 Days" button in warm orange (#FF6B35) pulses gently. No credit card icon appears below.
- Voiceover: "Try it free for 14 days. No credit card needed."
- Button text: "Start Free Trial"
- Landing page: taskflowpro.com/trial

**PRODUCTION NOTES:**
- Tone: Friendly, confident — like a senior freelancer showing a junior a better way
- Casting: Freelancer, 25–30, casual home office setup (natural light, minimal desk, laptop + second monitor)
- Music vibe: Lo-fi chill, upbeat but not corporate — builds slightly in energy from Problem → Solution
- Caption: Mandatory (85% watch without sound)
- Visual style: Clean, minimal UI screenshots on gradient backgrounds. Colors: deep purple (#6C3CE1) + warm orange (#FF6B35). No stock photos — use real product screenshots.

**A/B TEST NOTE:** Test variable: Pain Hook (this) vs Curiosity Hook (Variant B) — measure CTR difference at Day 3–5

## VARIANT B — Curiosity Hook — Static

**Primary text (first 125 chars most critical):** "What if one app could replace your Trello, your time tracker, AND your invoicing tool? 2,400+ freelancers already found out."

**Headline (max 40 chars):** "One Dashboard. Zero Chaos."

**Description (max 30 chars):** "Try free — no credit card."

**CTA Button:** Sign Up

**Image Direction:**
- Concept: TaskFlow Pro dashboard screenshot showing a Kanban board with 3 active projects, a running timer, and a "Send Invoice" button — all visible in a single view. A subtle "3-in-1" badge in the top corner.
- Composition: Dashboard screenshot centered on a deep purple (#6C3CE1) to dark gradient background, slightly angled (3D perspective tilt). White space around the screenshot to keep it clean. Headline text above, CTA below.
- Colour mood: Deep purple (#6C3CE1) background with warm orange (#FF6B35) accent on the CTA and key UI elements. Professional but approachable.

## TA SETTINGS — TaskFlow Pro — Phase 1

**DEMOGRAPHICS (Tier 1 — 3-angle reasoning):**

- **Age: 22–35**
  - Psychology: Identity-building stage — freelancers actively seeking tools that signal professionalism to clients and reinforce their self-image as "real business owners"
  - Use case: Independent budget decision-makers who choose their own tools, not locked into enterprise software contracts or IT department mandates
  - Cultural: US gig economy accelerating post-2024; this age group drives freelance platform adoption on Fiverr, Upwork, and Toptal — and they are most willing to pay for productivity SaaS

- **Gender: All**
  - Rationale: No significant gender skew in North American freelancer demographics across design, development, and content creation verticals

- **Location: United States (metro focus: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Miami, Chicago)**
  - Rationale: Highest freelancer density per capita + highest willingness to pay for USD-priced SaaS tools. Metro focus aligns with spec's NA market and persona description. These cities also index high for digital-first freelancer communities.

**INTEREST STACK (3 Layers — Tier 1):**

| Layer | Description | Interests | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Core | Direct use case mapping | Freelancing, Project Management, Time Tracking, Invoice Software | Maps directly to TaskFlow Pro's 3 core features (task management + time tracking + invoicing). Users searching for any of these tools are in the product's bullseye. |
| 2 — Adjacent | Expand reach, maintain relevance | Graphic Design, Web Development, Content Creation, Copywriting, UX Design | Core persona identifies as designers, developers, and content creators. These interests expand the net while maintaining relevance to the freelancer use case. |
| 3 — Behavioral | Purchase intent signals | Engaged Shoppers, Small Business Owners, Entrepreneurship, Self-Employed | Decision-making readiness + payment willingness. These users actively seek business tools and are comfortable paying for SaaS subscriptions. |

**LOOKALIKE (Tier 2):** Website visitors (beta signups) → 1% Lookalike audience. Source: 2,400 beta users from Product Hunt launch. Rationale: beta users are the highest-quality seed — they already self-selected into the product.

**PLACEMENTS (Tier 2):** Advantage+ Placements. Rationale: Phase 1 needs maximum data volume across all placements to identify winners. Let Meta's algorithm optimize delivery.

**NEGATIVE TARGETING:** Exclude existing beta users (custom audience upload), competitor employees (Trello, Asana, Atlassian, ClickUp company pages), age < 18, locations outside the United States.

**Phase 2 teaser:** After 14 days of data → transition to retargeting custom audiences: website visitors (non-converters), video viewers 50%+, and Lead Form openers who didn't submit.

## BUDGET PLAN — TaskFlow Pro — 14 days

**Total budget:** $1,000 USD | **Daily budget:** $71.43
**Campaign Type:** ABO (timeline = 14 days, ≥ 14 → ABO)

**CPA Benchmark:** SaaS / App category → $2–$8/lead | Target midpoint: **$5/lead**

**Budget Consolidation Check:**
- Default 3 ad sets: $71.43/day × 40% = $28.57/ad set (highest)
- Minimum viable budget per ad set: CPA $5 × 10 = $50/day
- $28.57 < $50 → **ad sets cannot exit learning phase with 3-way split**
- Weekly budget: $500/week → $500/week threshold met but not exceeded
- **Decision: Consolidate to 2 ad sets (60% / 40%)**

⚠️ Budget may be insufficient for 3 ad sets to exit learning phase. Consolidating to 2 ad sets.

| Ad Set | Audience | Budget/Day | Budget Split | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interest Stack | Layer 1+2 (Freelancing, Project Management, Time Tracking, Graphic Design, Web Development, Content Creation) | $42.86 | 60% | Validate hypothesis — highest intent audience first |
| Broad Test | 22–35, United States, no interest targeting | $28.57 | 40% | Let Meta's algorithm find audiences beyond our assumptions |

**Learning Phase Notes:**
- Each ad set needs ~50 conversions/week to exit learning phase
- Min budget/ad set = target CPA ($5) × 2 = $10/day — both ad sets exceed this minimum
- Interest Stack at $42.86/day can generate ~8 leads/day at $5 CPA → ~56/week (sufficient to exit learning)
- Broad Test at $28.57/day can generate ~5 leads/day at $5 CPA → ~35/week (borderline — may remain in learning)
- Do NOT modify ad sets in the first 7 days to avoid resetting learning phase

**Scale Trigger:** When 1 ad set achieves CPA ≤ $5 for 3 consecutive days → increase budget max 20%/day. If Interest Stack wins, shift Broad Test budget into it. If Broad Test outperforms, expand to a 3rd ad set with Lookalike audience.

## REVENUE PROJECTION — TaskFlow Pro — 14 days

**Budget:** $1,000 | **CPL target:** $5 (midpoint of SaaS $2–$8 range)
**Estimated leads:** 200 (expected case)

**LTV Calculation:** Average plan price ~$14/month (midpoint of $9 Basic and $19 Pro) × 6-month average retention = **$84 LTV/customer**

| Scenario | Leads | Lead-to-Customer Rate | Customers | LTV/Customer | Projected Revenue | ROAS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best | 500 ($2 CPL) | 10% | 50 | $84 | $4,200 | 4.20x |
| Expected | 200 ($5 CPL) | 5% | 10 | $84 | $840 | 0.84x |
| Worst | 125 ($8 CPL) | 2% | 2–3 | $84 | $210 | 0.21x |

**Breakeven:** ~Day 45 (Expected case). At 10 customers × $14/month, monthly revenue = $140. Total spend = $1,000. Breakeven requires ~7 months of retention at expected conversion rate. However, leads collected in Phase 1 continue converting beyond the 14-day campaign window — factor in a 90-day attribution window for SaaS lead gen.

⚠️ Note: Phase 1 typically runs at a loss; the goal is to buy audience data and build retargeting pools, not achieve positive ROI immediately.
⚠️ Figures are estimates based on industry benchmarks; actual results depend on creative quality, landing page conversion rate, and lead nurture sequence.

## A/B TEST ROADMAP — TaskFlow Pro — Standard (14–30 days)

**WEEK 1 — Hook Test:**
Run 4 hook variants (Pain, Curiosity, Transformation, Social Proof) in parallel, same audience, same budget per variant.
Decision metric: CTR (Click-Through Rate).
After 3–5 days → pick winner hook (highest CTR with statistical significance).

**WEEK 2 — CTA Test:**
Winner hook × 3 CTA variants ("Start Free Trial" vs "Try It Free" vs "See How It Works").
Decision metric: Conversion Rate (lead form submissions).
Pick best CTA combo.

**WEEK 3 — Audience Test:**
Winner hook + CTA × 2 audiences (Interest Stack vs Broad Test).
Decision metric: CPA (Cost Per Lead).
Pick best audience.

**WEEK 4 — Scale:**
Winner combo (hook + CTA + audience) → increase budget 20%/day.
Kill all losers. Begin planning Phase 2 (retargeting video viewers 50%+ and lead form openers).

**KILL CRITERIA (apply every week):**
- CTR < 1% after 3 days → kill variant
- CPA > 2× target ($10+) after 5 days → kill variant
- Frequency > 3.0 → audience saturated, kill or expand targeting

## DECISION TREE — TaskFlow Pro — Standard

| Day | Check | IF... | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | — | — | Learning phase, observe only. Do not touch ads or budgets. |
| 3 | CTR | < 1% on any variant | Swap hook on underperforming variant, keep audience unchanged |
| 3 | CPA | CTR ok but CPA > $10 | Check landing page load speed + form friction. Do not touch ads. |
| 3 | Both | CTR > 1% + CPA ≤ $5 | Continue, no changes — early winner signal |
| 7 | CPA | 1 ad set ≤ $5 target | Potential winner — run 3 more days to confirm consistency |
| 7 | CPA | All ad sets > $5 | Review: creative fatigue? Wrong audience? Landing page bounce rate? Adjust one variable only. |
| 7 | Frequency | > 2.5 on any ad set | Audience saturated — expand interest targeting or swap creative |
| 14 | CPA | ≤ $5 for 3 consecutive days | Scale winner 20%/day. Kill all losing variants. Reallocate budget. |
| 14 | CPA | No clear winner after 14 days | Pause campaign. Review product-market fit, landing page, and offer. Consider new creative angle before relaunching. |
| 14 | CPA | Fluctuating ($3 one day, $8 the next) | Run 7 more days with same setup — algorithm may still be optimizing |
| 21–30 | Scale | Winners identified | Scale winner ad set 20%/day. Build retargeting audiences from Phase 1 data (website visitors, video viewers 50%+, lead form openers). Begin Phase 2 campaign planning. |
